Interfaces are not a part of javascript. 

Interfaces consist of only the names of the class variables and methods that are expected to be 
implemented in a class that is based on this interface.

For example, a classic interface might look like:

interface Animal {
    limbs
    eyes
    tail

    walk()
    run()
    sit()
}

The corresponding classes that are based on this interface should mandatorily contain the attributes and methods.

The Interface Segregation Principle states the following:

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

- Robert C. Martin.

In the above statement, client refers to the implementing class of the interface.

So, it means a class should not be forced to write an implementation for a method which does not suit its character.
We have to split the interfaces separately such that an interface consists of only the attributes and methods that the implementing
classes would require.

If you want to implement interfaces in javascript, you can make use of typescript.
