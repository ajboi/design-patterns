According to the Dependency inversion principle,

A. Higher level modules should not depend on lower level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

A dependency can be any class or modules whose attributes/methods are used by other classes.
Higher-level would refer to a class that does higher abstraction stuff like Input/Output
Lower-level would refer to a class that does lower abstraction complex stuff like handling network communications.
